Click "Create New" and name the API Key. Do not share this with others, as it give people

If you plan to make a different use of the wisp API, skip this part.

We will start by logging into https://discord.com/developers/applications and then clicking on "New Application". Name it whatever you want, and then continue.
On the next page, you will find a "Bot" tab on the left. Create a new bot, and then follow the steps create it. Copy your token and store it somewhere secure.
